### [jmpost](https://github.com/Genentech/jmpost?tab=readme-ov-file)

The goal of the R package is to fit joint models involving:

&emsp; 1. a parametric time-to-event sub-model,

&emsp; 2. a nonlinear (or linear) mixed-effect sub-model, describing individual time profiles (i.e. trajectories) for a continuous marker,

&emsp; 3. a link function (a.k.a. association term).
More specifically, the model implemented in this package utilizes a modelling framework described previously [1-3] to link overall survival to tumour size data in oncology clinical trials.

The models are implemented in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), and the package provides a flexible user interface.
