My research interests center on developing statistical methodologies to address challenges in precision medicine, genomics, and clinical trials. I am particularly focused on integrating multi-omics data to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases like Alzheimer’s and breast cancer, using techniques such as similarity network fusion, causal mediation analysis, and transfer learning. In clinical trials, I am interested in response-adaptive randomization (RAR) and Bayesian methods to optimize treatment allocation, improve statistical power, and reduce sample sizes. Additionally, I aim to advance Bayesian methodologies for modeling high-dimensional genetic data and dynamic processes, enabling robust inferences and actionable insights in biomedical research.
